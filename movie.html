    <h1>The Last Soldier</h1>
    <h2>Some battles never end</h2>
    <img src="movie.jpg" alt="movie">
    <p>A war veteran is forced to confront his past when detectives ask for his help in tracking down an old comrade—someone he believed died in battle. As the search unfolds, he uncovers a shocking truth: his friend was part of a secret military experiment that brought dead soldiers back to life.</p>

    <p>Mike, a former soldier, lives in isolation, haunted by memories of war. He avoids people and refuses to talk about his past. But one day, detectives come to him with an urgent case. A man linked to multiple murders is someone Mike recognizes—Sergeant Miller, his former comrade, who was supposed to be dead.</p>

    <p>At first, Mike refuses to help. He doesn’t want to reopen old wounds. But when the detectives show him photos of the victims, he realizes that some of them were fellow soldiers. Something about this doesn’t add up. Determined to find answers, he finally agrees to join the investigation.

        As Mike digs deeper, he starts having flashbacks—memories he didn’t even know were missing. He remembers a secret military experiment designed to bring soldiers back from the dead. The more he uncovers, the more he realizes that Miller isn’t the only one who was “revived”—Mike himself was part of the experiment too.</p>

        <p>Now, Mike must make a choice: help the detectives stop Miller before more people die, or uncover the truth about what really happened to him and the others. But one thing is clear—the past isn’t finished with him yet.</p>

        <p>Sergeant Miller—once a brother-in-arms, now a dangerous and unstable man haunted by the same experiments that changed Mike too.
            The Military Organization—the people behind the secret experiment, who will do anything to keep the truth buried.
            </p>

            <p>Mike struggles with two battles: 
                Stopping Miller, a man he once trusted, before he kills again, and facing the truth about what was done to him during the war and what it means for his future.
                
                Mike remembers the truth—he and Miller were both part of the same experiment. They weren’t just survivors; they were brought back from the dead. Now, Miller’s mind is breaking, and Mike realizes he could be next.
                At the start, Mike is lost, running from his past. By the end, he accepts who he is and takes control of his fate. Instead of hiding, he fights back—not just against Miller, but against the people who turned them into weapons.
                
                Mike finally tracks down Miller. Instead of a simple fight, it’s a painful confrontation between two men who were once like brothers. In the end, Miller dies, and Mike exposes the truth about the experiments. But while the world moves on, Mike knows the battle inside him will never truly end.</p>
