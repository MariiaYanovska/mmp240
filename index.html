    <p style="border: 2px solid rgb(213, 159, 150);">I'm studying in BMCC, majoring in Multimedia Programming and Design. I'm from Ukraine, and live in USA 2.5 years.
        Iâ€™m a hardworking and creative person, balancing my studies, work, and internship while pursuing my passions. I have a strong interest in design, marketing, and music, and I love expressing myself through songwriting. Moving to the U.S. from Ukraine was a big change, and sometimes I feel like an outsider, but I keep pushing forward, learning, and growing. I also want to build a successful future doing what I love.
