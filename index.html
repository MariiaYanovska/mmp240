    <p>My email: mariia.yanovska61@stu.bmcc.cuny.edu</p>
    <p>I'm studying in BMCC, majoring in Multimedia Programming and Design. I'm from Ukraine, and live in USA 2.5 years.</p>
    <p>Iâ€™m a hardworking and creative person, balancing my studies, work, and internship while pursuing my passions. I have a strong interest in design, marketing, and music, and I love expressing myself through songwriting. Moving to the U.S. from Ukraine was a big change, and sometimes I feel like an outsider, but I keep pushing forward, learning, and growing. I also want to build a successful future doing what I love.</p>
