    <h2>How to Make Chicken Marsala with Creamy Sauce</h2>
    <ol>

    <li>Prepare chicken cutlets: Meanwhile in season both sides of chicken with salt and pepper. Dredge in flour.</li>
    <li>Cook chicken through in skillet: Melt 1 Tbsp butter with 1 Tbsp olive oil in a 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken pieces and let sear until cooked through (165 in center), turning once halfway through, about 10 – 12 minutes.</li>
